Hi! 
===

I am currently a Master's student at the University of Pennsylvania in Scientific Computing. I am working here with [Prof. Mark Liberman](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~myl/) at the [Linguistic Data Consortium](https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/).

I am interested in several research directions : 
- Theoretical Machine Learning
- Learning in Physical Systems
- Natural Language Processing
- Quantum Information and Computing
- Computational Condensed Matter
- Asset Pricing and Stochastic Processes

I have had the good fortune of being advised by some truly awesome people.

In 2020 I spent an awesome year at [RIKEN, Japan](https://www.riken.jp/en/) advised by [Prof. Neill Lambert](http://dustygeeks.org/Neill/?page_id=21) working in [Prof. Franco Nori's](https://dml.riken.jp/) Theoretical Quantum Physics Group for about a year. We worked on some super cool projects across Open Quantum Systems, Combinatorial Optimization and Machine Learning.

In 2019, I interned at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) advised by [Prof. Karthik Ramachandra](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/karam/), where we worked on [Project Froid](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/froid/).

In 2019, I completed my Bachelor's Thesis with [Prof. Sreejith GJ](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/research/department/physics/people/faculty/regular-faculty/sreejith-g-j/269) at [IISER, Pune](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/), where we worked on tailoring density matrix renormalization groups to the Potts' Model.
